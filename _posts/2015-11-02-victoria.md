[Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(ship)) was the first ship to circumnavigate the glove. Quite the ambitious goal and out of 5 ships, only [Victoria](https://github.com/grossadamm/victoria) made it.

*Goals for this project:*

1. Cross the pacific
2. Circumnavigate the globe
3. Remain under $2000
4. Do not require any human input after launch

### Arduino ###

To start with, everything will be controlled by a single arduino mega pro. Mega, so that I don't run out of precious storage/ram space; and pro so I don't waste precious power doing silly things like lighting leds no one will ever see.

I've broken down the build into four main phases:

### [Phase 1](https://github.com/grossadamm/victoria/milestones/Phase%201) ###

- Acquire Arduino
- Read/handle temperatures
- Remote control
- GPS navigation programming
- Rudder control

### Phase 2 ###

- Motor control
- Battery hookup
- Automated navigation

### Phase 3 ###

- Solar

### Phase 4 ###

- GPS comms
- Storm detection
- Final construction
