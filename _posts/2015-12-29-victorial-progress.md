Hit a goal!

The code for manual control and automated control is "working". I've done limited testing. 

Next up, hardware testing!

The next step is to mount the electronics and rudder servo unit on a piece of wood and make sure the rudder turns like it should based on the manual and automated control directions.

After that, verify propulsion will work as expcted and order the propulsion motors. 

Right now there are no motors, but I can use LEDs or just watch some kind of diagnostic to verify they do during the initial testing phases.
