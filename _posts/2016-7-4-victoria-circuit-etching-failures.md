### DIY Etching failures ###

I've been trying to etch my own circuit boards and have repeatedly failed. I've tried using the highest density of toner out out of laser printer, and after ironing for almost 30 minutes, the toner still adheres too tightly to the paper instead of the copper.

I'm ordering [Press N Peel](http://www.ebay.com/itm/152080335979) and hopefully that works out better.
